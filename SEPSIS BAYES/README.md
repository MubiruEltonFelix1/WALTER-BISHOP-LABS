# SEPSIS-BAYES: A Real-Time Bayesian Clinical Reasoning System for Early Sepsis Detection

Sepsis-Bayes is a clinical reasoning framework designed to support hospitals in detecting and responding to sepsis earlier and more accurately than conventional rule-based systems. The system centers around the idea that sepsis should not be treated as a simple yes-or-no diagnosis but as a probability that evolves as new clinical evidence emerges. In settings such as Uganda, where hospital resources are stretched and the timely interpretation of clinical signals can mean the difference between life and death, a probabilistic clinical support system built on Bayesian inference offers a powerful new tool for clinicians.

The core idea behind Sepsis-Bayes is to take the uncertainty inherent in early sepsis symptoms and turn it into quantitative information that clinicians can use to guide decisions in real time. Traditional sepsis screening tools, such as SIRS and qSOFA scores, rely on heuristics or thresholds that can be too rigid or insensitive to nuance. In contrast, Bayes’ formula gives a clinician a way to incorporate both prior knowledge — such as how common sepsis is in a particular ward or patient demographic — and new evidence from tests and observations to calculate an updated probability that the patient has sepsis at that moment. When this probability crosses a specified threshold, the system alerts clinicians to consider immediate intervention or further confirmatory testing.

Sepsis itself is a condition defined by the body’s dysregulated response to infection, leading to organ dysfunction and ultimately, if untreated, to organ failure and death. The early signs of sepsis are often subtle: a slightly elevated temperature, an increased heart rate, or an isolated low blood pressure reading. Over the course of hours, these signs can escalate into severe systemic inflammatory response, causing respiratory distress, altered consciousness, and shock. One of the key challenges in treating sepsis is that patients can appear relatively stable in the first six hours of onset, while already entering a pathological process that can accelerate rapidly. The mortality rate for sepsis increases significantly after 12 to 24 hours without intervention. Thus being able to recognize the condition in its earliest phase is critical to improving outcomes.

In Uganda, national referral hospitals such as Mulago Hospital in Kampala, regional referral centers like Mbale Regional Referral Hospital, and district-level facilities including Arua and Mbarara Hospitals see thousands of patients with infections that have the potential to progress to sepsis. Many of these cases occur in patients with recent surgery, known infections such as malaria or pneumonia, or comorbidities such as HIV, which is prevalent in parts of the country. In these settings, clinicians must balance the urgency of treating life-threatening conditions with the practical reality of limited intensive care capacity, diagnostic testing availability, and staffing. A Bayesian clinical support system offers a way to bring greater clarity to this decision-making process, by combining hospital-level prevalence data with individual patient factors to generate meaningful risk estimates.

To make the Bayesian model concrete, it is useful to look at how the system assigns initial probability values — called priors — before any new evidence is introduced. The prior probability represents the baseline likelihood that a patient has sepsis before recent vital signs or lab results are considered. This prior depends on several contextual factors. The first of these is hospital location: a patient admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) at Mulago Hospital, where many cases of severe infection are treated, will have a higher prior probability for sepsis than a patient in a general outpatient ward at a smaller regional facility. For instance, based on historical data from Kampala-area referral hospitals, the ICU prior might be set at approximately 20 percent, while a general medicine ward might have a prior closer to 5 percent. A recent surgery adds another layer of risk because surgical patients are more susceptible to systemic infection; in such a case, the baseline prior might rise by several percentage points.

Known infections also shift the prior. A patient presenting with confirmed pneumonia, especially if accompanied by sputum cultures indicating bacterial infection, carries a higher baseline sepsis risk than a patient with a single nonspecific symptom such as fever. Age plays a role as well. Elderly patients, and very young patients such as neonates, are at higher risk of sepsis due to immune system differences. In an adult general ward in Mbarara Hospital, a 65-year-old patient with a recent history of urinary tract infection might be assigned a prior of 12 percent, whereas a 30-year-old patient in the same ward with no known infection might start at 4 percent. These priors are not static; they are updated periodically as more hospital data is incorporated into the system, enabling the model to reflect seasonal variations or changes in regional prevalence.

Once the prior is established, evidence begins to accumulate. Evidence in this context includes clinical observations and laboratory results. A slightly elevated body temperature might nudge the probability upward; an abnormal lactate level, which suggests tissue hypoxia, could move it much more dramatically. Each piece of evidence is characterized by two values: the probability of observing that evidence if the patient truly has sepsis, and the probability of observing it if the patient does not. These likelihood values come from clinical studies, hospital records, and meta-analyses. Elevated lactate, for example, might be present in 70 percent of sepsis cases but only in 20 percent of non-sepsis inflammatory conditions, giving it high discriminative value.

The Bayesian engine of Sepsis-Bayes is embodied in a core equation that combines the prior and the likelihoods of all observed evidence to produce an updated or posterior probability. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

[
P(\text{Sepsis} \mid E_1, \dots, E_n)
=====================================

\frac{
P(\text{Sepsis}) \cdot \prod*{i=1}^n P(E_i \mid \text{Sepsis})
}{
P(\text{Sepsis}) \cdot \prod*{i=1}^n P(E*i \mid \text{Sepsis}) + P(\neg\text{Sepsis}) \cdot \prod*{i=1}^n P(E_i \mid \neg\text{Sepsis})
}
]

Here, (P(\text{Sepsis})) represents the prior, and (E_1, \dots, E_n) represent the evidence signals such as elevated heart rate or abnormal white blood cell count. A practical strength of this formula is that it can be computed in real time as each new piece of evidence becomes available, allowing clinicians to see the patient’s sepsis probability evolve.

To illustrate how this process works in practice, consider a hypothetical case at Mbale Regional Referral Hospital. A 58-year-old male patient arrives at the emergency department after a week of cough and fever. He has a history of diabetes and was discharged from a surgical ward three days earlier. Based on his clinical profile — recent surgery, known infection symptoms, and age — the Bayesian system assigns him a prior of 15 percent for sepsis. Initial vital signs show a fever of 38.5°C and a slightly elevated heart rate. As the system incorporates these evidence signals, the posterior probability rises from 0.15 to 0.24. A subsequent lab test reveals a high lactate level, a strong discriminator for sepsis, pushing the probability above 0.50. At this point, the Sepsis-Bayes system would indicate to the clinical team that the patient has crossed a critical threshold and that immediate intervention is warranted.

One of the primary benefits of using a Bayesian reasoning system in this way is that it mirrors expert clinical thinking while making the reasoning transparent and repeatable. A seasoned clinician might intuitively recognize that the combination of diabetes, recent surgery, fever, and high lactate points toward sepsis. What the Bayesian system does is convert that intuition into numbers, providing a clear, quantitative rationale for intervention and enabling clinicians to communicate risk consistently across shifts and teams.

The development of Sepsis-Bayes is not just an academic exercise; it reflects a practical need in hospitals across Uganda and similar healthcare environments. Facilities such as Mulago Hospital, Mbarara Hospital, and Arua Hospital treat a wide range of infectious diseases and see patients whose conditions can deteriorate quickly. By providing clinicians with a probabilistic framework that intelligibly incorporates both individual and population-level information, Sepsis-Bayes has the potential to improve decision quality and reduce mortality from sepsis.

This GitHub repository serves as a living document and implementation guide for the Sepsis-Bayes project. It contains not only the mathematical foundation and clinical narrative presented here but also code examples, data schemas, and instructions for integrating the Bayesian engine into hospital information systems. The project is designed to be extensible, allowing future contributors to adapt the model to other conditions beyond sepsis, integrate additional real-time evidence sources, and refine the priors based on local data. By grounding the system in Bayesian decision theory and embedding it in real-world clinical practice, Sepsis-Bayes aims to bridge the gap between uncertainty and informed action, ultimately saving lives where timing is everything.
